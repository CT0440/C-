-----------
inputOutputStream<iostream> which contains standard input and standard output.
#include is a preprocessor directive which tells the compiler to get specifice file
like #include<iostream>

cout is used for writes the data to the standared output stream then the streams 
will display on the console.

<<(insetion operator)-sends data to output stream

cin - read data in standard input stream
>>(Extraction operator)-extracts data from input stream
::(scope resolution operator) is used for it tells the compiler to look inside the std 
namespace

***how cpp Works?***
->here this helloworld.cpp file is highlevel programming language(human readable)
that takes by the compiler(g++).
->compiler translates the highlevel to assembly level
language that understanded by machine 
->assembler takes the assembly language file and converts to lowlevl language
(machine code) .
and finally that file called as object code.
->linker takes the object file to produce executable code.
->executable code contains all the machine code instructions required to run the
program i.e script.
->whenever user executes .exe file then it handed to cpu that displays the 
the output on the target system.

namespaces in C++
-----------------
A namespace is a container or a mechnism used in programming to organize and 
group related code elements(such as classes, functions) under a unique identifier.

It  helps prevent naming conflicts and makes code more readable, maintainable and modular.
